## Introduction
Packages provide valuable functionality, yet they introduce a level of dependency. We must incorporate their service providers into our applications and adhere to their documentation, even for tasks we could accomplish independently.

Personally, I've often felt overwhelmed, particularly when tasked with creating tables for countries, states, and cities using Laravel migrations and seeding them. Consequently, I've developed migrations and seeders to streamline this process, drawing inspiration from two widely recognized repositories (credited below).

### Note!
It is important to note that this is not a stand-alone package, but instead contains migration and seeder files for countries, states, cities, districts and villages. You are free to use standard Laravel relationships and code in your projects as needed.

## Features
* Migrations and Seeders for Country, State, City, District, and Village Tables.
* Comprehensive and accurate data to establish a strong foundation for location management.
* Easily integrable into existing Laravel projects.
* Expandable data structure to meet the specific needs of your project.

## Requirements
* PHP `^8.1` or Above
* Laravel 9 or Above

## Getting started
To install **Laravel World**, follow these steps:

Clone repository and move migrations and seeders into relevant directories.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhamdaily/laravel-world.git
```

Register Seeders into `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php` by adding these line in run method
```php
public function run(): void
{
    // \App\Models\User::factory(10)->create();

    // \App\Models\User::factory()->create([
    //     'name' => 'Test User',
    //     'email' => 'test@example.com',
    // ]);

    $this->call(CountrySeeder::class);
    $this->call(StateSeeder::class);
    $this->call(CitySeeder::class);
    $this->call(DistrictSeeder::class);
    $this->call(VillageSeeder::class);
}
```

Run Migrations and Seed the Database.
```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

If you want to run fresh migrations and seed the database, you can use the following command:
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```
This command will drop all tables and then re-run the migrations, seeding the database with the initial data.
